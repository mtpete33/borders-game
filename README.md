# Borders

**Borders** is a sleek, daily word puzzle game that challenges players to complete four valid English words around the border of a grid. With only a few starting letters revealed, players must deduce the rest using logic, vocabulary, and pattern recognition.

## ✍️ Developer Notes

This project was built as a fun, strategic twist on the classic daily word game format inspired by my love of Wordle. Unlike fixed-answer games, Borders allows for creative thinking, as any valid combination of border words can be correct.

The puzzle system, leaderboard, and user stats are all built for long-term daily use, with minimal admin maintenance required.
